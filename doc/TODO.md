# TODO

* Find better searching algorithm for Typo3 login.
* Search for Typo3 version-specific extensions
* Some extensions don't have any version information. These extensions must be listed in settings.NO_VERSIONINFO.
* Maybe use one library for all requests
* Test on other platforms
* Add screenshot
* Give the possibility to use POST instead of GET requests
